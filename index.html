        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
        100% recommend! ”
